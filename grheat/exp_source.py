"""
Green's function heat transfer solutions for a vertical exponential line.

This module provides solutions to heat transfer for point illumination
of an absorbing semi-infinite medium. The solutions are
based on the mathematical formulations provided in Carslaw and Jaeger's work.

The `ExpSource` class represents a vertical linear heat source that extends
downward in the medium for coordinates (xp, yp) in the medium. The medium's surface
is defined by z=0. The class provides methods to calculate the temperature rise
at any position (x, y, z) at a specified time `t`, due to different types of
heat source behaviors.

Three types of line sources are supported:

- **Instantaneous**:
  Represents a single, instantaneous illumination of a point on absorbing medium.

- **Continuous**:
  Represents a continuous point illumination of an absorbing medium from t=0.

- **Pulsed**:
  Represents a pulsed illumination of a point from t=0 to t=`t_pulse`.

Each of these line sources can be analyzed under different boundary conditions at z=0:

- `'infinite'`: No boundary (infinite medium).
- `'adiabatic'`: No heat flow across the boundary.
- `'zero'`: Boundary is fixed at T=0.
